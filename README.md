# omnibus-centos

A docker image containing centos, ruby, go, git, omnibus-ruby, omnibus-software, and omnibus-flapjack.

[omnibus-flapjack](https://github.com/flapjack/omnibus-flapjack) depends on the docker images created by this project to build packages for CentOS and RHEL.

There's no reason you couldn't use this for building rpms for other projects as well.
